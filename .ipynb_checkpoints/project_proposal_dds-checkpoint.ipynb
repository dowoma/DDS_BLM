    "### Early Brainstorming for the Study of Public Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Several high-profile cases in 2020 and 2021 have reignited conversations about race and racial tension in the United States. With the Black Lives Matter movement growing larger than ever, there were nationwide protests and social media was flooded with posts of people expressing their thoughts on how race affects everyone's lives in America. Many were in favor of the movement and were distraught at the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Armaud Arbery, and other victims of police violence. They made calls to defund the police in the US, and stated that any transformation of the police system would be insufficient to solve the problem, which could only be solved by abolishing the system altogether and creating a new one. With all these conversations taking place online as well as in the news and in people's homes, the behavior of police officers during encounters with people of color was brought under scrutiny. But has this movement succeeded in actually influencing the outcomes of police encounters for people of color across the nation? Has there been a measurable decrease in the deaths of people of color, and specifically Black Americans, at the hands of the police which can be correlated with the activism surrounding the BLM movement?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is what our team set out to answer, and though quantifying the rates of deaths of Black Americans and other people of color during police encounters is quite straightforward, quantifying the reach of the BLM movement over time is more complex. Our team considered looking at Twitter posts and hashtags as a way to see the trend in the movement's popularity over time. As we discussed this approach, we decided to broaden our data points by not just looking at directly available data (i.e., number of tweets or hashtags), but creating a model that uses machine learning and sentiment analysis to determine what people were really talking about online in relation to the BLM movement. Were they in support? What were they saying when major events took place? What were they proposing should be done? These questions can be answered by looking at Twitter posts, but require the use of such a model in order to examine a large volume of posts. This is what made us decide to use such a model to obtain a more comprehensive dataset of the impact of the BLM movement on how people spoke about race and police injustices, which we can then use to see more clearly whether real outcomes were influenced by the conversations being had across the country."
